Note: To share all of our Unity stuff, I think we each have to enable it. From the menu, go to Edit->Project Settings->Editor, then select Meta Files from the Version Control drop-down menu. (http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/ExternalVersionControlSystemSupport.html)

Another Note: Do NOT share your Temp or Library folders! (or someone can create an ignore file...)
